Interfaces to the packaged application {#interfaces_to_apps}
==================================

UCM specification for this release does not contain interfaces towards a
packaged application which the latter could use for example to execute
OnUpdate calls, e.g. to migrate its own persistency data to a new structure.
Therefore also the demonstrator implementation does not contain interfaces
towards packaged applications at this point.
